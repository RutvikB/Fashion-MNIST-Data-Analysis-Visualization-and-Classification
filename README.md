# Fashion-MNIST-Data-Analysis-Visualization-and-Classification

This repository contains an elaborate analysis and classification of the FASHION MNIST Dataset using various machine learning algorithms and methods. <br>
They include SVM, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc. and also some Ensemble Learning Methods like Stacking and Voting. <br>
I've also tried using Deep Learning Methods of a simple CNN, a Convolutional Autoencoder, and some pre-trained ML models available in Keras Applications API.
